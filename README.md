# example-codes-in-C++

This is a set of example source codes written in C++. 
The examples are intended to be used either as an extensive tutorial on C++ for beginners, or as hints for experienced programmers.
1) Some example codes are inspired by contents in the chapters of book "A Complete Guide to Programming in C++" by Ulla Kirch-Prinz and Peter Prinz.

2) Examples starting with LA_ aim at using package LAPACK++. The license of the package is shown below.
